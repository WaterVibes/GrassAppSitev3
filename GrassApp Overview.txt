GrassApp: Context for PaymentCloud

What is GrassApp?

GrassApp is a marketplace facilitator that connects consumers with licensed dispensaries and smoke shops for cannabis and non-tobacco product delivery. GrassApp does not directly sell cannabis, tobacco, or non-tobacco paraphernalia, and it does not warehouse, package, or distribute any of the products it facilitates for delivery. Instead, GrassApp acts as a technology platform that provides dispensaries and smoke shops with an efficient, user-friendly way to reach customers. GrassApp may sell its own branded merchandise directly but is not involved in the physical handling of the cannabis or non-tobacco products it facilitates.

How GrassApp Works

Marketplace Facilitation

GrassApp acts as a digital marketplace, allowing customers to browse and order products directly from licensed dispensaries and smoke shops.

It provides a centralized platform for product listings, order placement, and real-time tracking, without maintaining inventory or fulfilling orders directly.

Secure Transactions and Payment Processing

GrassApp facilitates secure payment processing for transactions between customers and vendors.

All payments are processed securely through a third-party payment gateway (e.g., PaymentCloud), ensuring compliance with financial regulations.

GrassApp never holds or directly manages funds related to cannabis sales.

Real-Time Order Management

GrassApp provides vendors with a suite of tools for managing orders, including live inventory updates, driver assignment, and real-time delivery tracking.

The platform ensures all orders are initiated by the customer and fulfilled by the vendor without GrassApp acting as the seller of record.

Regulatory Compliance

GrassApp operates strictly as a marketplace facilitator and adheres to all relevant state and federal regulations.

The platform does not handle, package, or distribute cannabis or paraphernalia, focusing instead on connecting customers with licensed vendors.

GrassApp only partners with businesses that hold the necessary licenses to operate in their respective jurisdictions.

Key Benefits for Payment Processors

Scalable Model: GrassAppâ€™s marketplace approach allows for seamless scaling without the need for physical infrastructure.
