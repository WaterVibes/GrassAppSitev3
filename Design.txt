Design & Visual Aesthetics

1. Color Scheme

Primary Colors: Black (#000000) and Dark Green (#1B5E20) to reflect a sleek, modern, and natural aesthetic.

Accent Colors: Neon Green (#00FF00) for interactive elements (buttons, highlights) to create contrast.

Typography Colors: White (#FFFFFF) for text to ensure readability against the dark background.

2. Design Elements

Minimalist, high-contrast UI with bold text and clean button designs.

Rounded corners on UI components for a modern, app-friendly look.

Product images showcased in high resolution with soft shadows for emphasis.

Interactive animations (hover effects, smooth transitions) for a premium feel.

3. Visual Aesthetics

Dark-themed interface with neon green highlights for an edgy, high-tech feel.

Vibrant images for product display to make items visually appealing.

Micro-interactions (e.g., subtle button pulses, hover effects) to enhance user engagement.

4. UI/UX Patterns

Card-based layout for dispensary and product listings.

Sticky navigation bar for easy access to cart and profile.

One-tap checkout process for quick, seamless purchases.

Live order tracking interface with a map and real-time updates.

Dark mode default with a possible light mode toggle in future iterations.

Next Steps for Cursor

Set up a Web App Framework

Use Next.js (React) or Vue.js for the frontend.

Ensure it is mobile-friendly from the start.

Build the Proxy Server

Use FastAPI (Python) or Node.js (Express) to fetch dispensary menus.

Implement caching with Redis.

Develop the Cart & Checkout System

Allow users to add items to their cart without redirecting to dispensary platforms.

Implement GrassApp-controlled payments.

Launch Web App Before Expanding to Mobile Apps

The web app should be fully functional before moving to native mobile development.
